<h2>About App</h2>
This app is an online shopping app that allows users to browse and purchase products from various categories. It is built with the following requirements in mind:

<b>Authentication:</b> The app allows users to sign up with their details such as name, email, password, address, and phone number. Users can also log in using their email and password. Once logged in, the user's ID is stored to keep them logged in even after restarting the app. A logout button is provided for users to log out of the app.

<b>Product Listing: The app lists product categories, and on clicking a category, it displays the products available in that category. On clicking a product, it displays the product description, price, and allows the user to add the product to their cart or remove it. The user can also change the quantity of the product they wish to purchase.

<b>Cart: The app shows a cart summary, the total amount of all products in the cart, and allows the user to place an order. Once an order is placed, a notification is displayed. The app also allows the user to view their order history.

<b>User details: The app displays user details such as name, email, address, and phone number. A random circular profile image is generated for each user. Users can also update their GPS coordinates if they wish to.

<b>UI/Implementation requirements: The app uses RecyclerView for all lists, and if the user is logged in, an authentication token is attached to all requests. An "About this app" button is provided on the profile page, which displays the credits for the app.

The app is built using the fake store API available at https://fakestoreapi.com/. The API provides resources such as user details, product categories, products in a particular category, and order history. All resources have the same structure as the JSON API responses for automatic parsing using Gson and to build JSON back from objects for POST requests without much manual intervention.
In terms of implementation, the app is built with Kotlin and uses various libraries such as Retrofit for network requests, Glide for image loading, and Room for local storage. The app uses an MVVM architecture pattern to separate the UI from the business logic and data storage.
In conclusion, the app provides a seamless shopping experience for users with features such as authentication, product listing, cart management, and order history. The app's user interface is intuitive, and the implementation is efficient.
